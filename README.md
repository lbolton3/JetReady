### Problem and Scope

#### Problem Statement

Traveling can be stressful, especially when coordinating with friends or family arriving at the airport. One common issue is determining the best time to leave for the airport to pick up arriving passengers. Factors such as flight delays, traffic conditions, and waiting time at the airport can make this task challenging. The goal is to develop a web application that helps users identify the optimal time to leave for the airport, minimizing waiting time and ensuring timely pickups.

#### Scope of the Project

The scope of this project is to develop a web application that assists users in determining the best time to leave for the airport to pick up their friends or family members. The application will take into account various factors, including:

1. **Flight Information:**

   - Real-time flight status updates (arrival time, delays, gate changes).
   - Airline and flight number input by the user.

2. **Traffic Conditions:**

   - Real-time traffic data to estimate travel time to the airport.
   - Integration with traffic APIs (e.g., Google Maps, Waze).

3. **User Notifications:**

   - Sending notifications (e.g., SMS, email, app notifications) to users about the best time to leave based on current conditions.

4. **User Interface:**

   - A simple and intuitive interface for users to input flight details and receive recommendations.
   - A dashboard displaying relevant information and updates.

5. **Backend Integration:**

   - Backend services to handle real-time data processing.
   - Integration with third-party APIs for flight and traffic data.

6. **User Accounts and Preferences:**
   - Allow users to create accounts to save preferences and flight information.
   - Customizable notification settings.
